Instructions:
Download and open project in Visual Studio Code.
Create database for print_manager using SQL.
Run PSQL command in your terminal: PSQL -d print_manager f db/print_manager.
Run the console.py file using python3 in your terminal to populate the tables.
Run flask in your terminal before opening the app in your browser. 

The brief for this project was to create a shop inventory app and is as follows:
    Build an app which allows a shopkeeper to track their shop's inventory. This is not an app which the customer will see, it is an admin/management app for the shop workers.
    MVP
    The inventory should track individual products, including a name, description, stock quantity, buying cost, and selling price.
    The inventory should track manufacturers, including a name and any other appropriate details.
    The shop can sell anything you like, but you should be able to create and edit manufacturers and products separately.
    This might mean that it makes more sense for a car shop to track makes and models of cars. Or a bookstore might sell books by author, or by publisher, and not by manufacturer. You are free to name classes and tables as appropriate to your project.
    Show an inventory page, listing all the details for all the products in stock in a single view.
    As well as showing stock quantity as a number, the app should visually highlight "low stock" and "out of stock" items to the user.
 I also worked on a couple of extensions which allowed the user to filter the products by artist and view the markup on a particular item.
